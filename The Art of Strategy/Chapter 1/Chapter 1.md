# Chapter 1

## \#1. Pick a number
	The authors have picked a number between 1 to 100. You have 5 guesses to pick the correct number between 1 to 100. If you guess correctly 
on the first try, you win $100, second try $80, and so on. What is your strategy?
	> Given that the authors have picked a number and don't want to pay money, they will try to hide their number. So numbers such as
	> 50, 25, 37, 42... are out. Therefore since we have 5 guess all divisions by 2 up to the fifth are most likely not it.
	> Going up from 50 we would guess, 75
		> Up again 88
		> Up again 94
		> Up again 97
	> Going down from 50 we would guess, 25, 12, 6, 3
